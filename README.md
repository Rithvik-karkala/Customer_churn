Customer Churn Prediction Project - Readme
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using a dataset that includes various features such as senior citizen status, monthly charges, total charges, and gender. The target variable, "Churn," indicates whether a customer has churned or not. The dataset also includes binary-encoded categorical features, representing variables like gender, partner status, and payment method, as well as grouped tenure information.

Business Questions Addressed

1. What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn, in the context of this project, refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with the telecom provider. The project aims to predict and understand the factors influencing churn to develop targeted retention strategies.

2. Key Features Impacting Churn
The analysis explores the significance of various features in influencing customer churn. Key factors may include monthly charges, total charges, tenure groups, and other demographic variables. Understanding these factors is crucial for identifying at-risk customers and implementing proactive retention measures.

3. Impact of Contract Type
The dataset likely contains information about the type of contracts customers have. Analyzing the impact of contract types on churn can provide insights into the effectiveness of different service plans. This understanding can guide the development of tailored contract offerings to reduce churn.


Project Execution
The project utilizes machine learning techniques, possibly employing classification algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods. The dataset is likely split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Next Steps
Feature Importance Analysis: Conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the most influential features impacting churn.

Model Evaluation and Selection: Evaluate multiple models to choose the one with the best predictive performance.

Retention Strategy Development: Based on insights gained, develop targeted retention strategies to reduce customer churn.

Continuous Monitoring: Implement a system for ongoing monitoring of churn rates and model performance to adapt strategies as needed.

Collaboration with Stakeholders: Collaborate with business stakeholders to integrate insights into decision-making processes and improve customer retention initiatives.
